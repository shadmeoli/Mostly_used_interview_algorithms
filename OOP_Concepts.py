"""
I am trying to learn the concepts of:
    [ ] dunder methods
    [ ] cls methods
    [ ] self methods
    [ ] walrus methods
    [ ] how to avoid reference counting and also circular imports
    [ ] Decorator pattern with classes
    [ ] Instance and class methods

Most of these are OOP concepts which I would be also using a more 
OOP centered language like C++, C# of Java
