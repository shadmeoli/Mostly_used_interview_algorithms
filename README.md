# Interview question with solutions

Welcome to the Algorithms and Programming Problems Repository! This repository is organized to facilitate learning and practice of algorithms and programming problems in various languages including TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, and Python. Below is an in-depth guide to the structure of this repository:
Most of the questions are from coding interviwes and codewars while some are from leetcode

## Authors

## Appendix

Any additional information goes here

Most of the questions are based on 1D-arrays & 2D-arrays and some need use of hash maps | dictionaries | sets | heap

> I am also adding some conepts mostly OOP concepts first with python but late with more OOP centered languages
> like **Java** and **c++**


**From now on most complex OOP concepts I will be implementing them either with c++ of Java**

#### Why Java or C++.
To my preference I believe these are some of the languages tha use deep OOP concepts which are building blocks of how some things work mostly algorithms and data sctructures
